## Summary:

At high level from the above analysis, it is clear that the PyBer as a company needs to work on increasing the total ride count in Rural city type and better utilization of the drivers in Urban city type.

### Recommendations:
1. Increasing the average Fare per Driver in Urban city type by doing one of the below:
    - Run promos to increase the number of rides and utilize the extra drivers (1,625 rides versus 2,405 drivers)
    - Increase ride fare
    - Decrease the drivers
2. Increase total fares in Rural city type 
    - Increase drivers
    - Run promos
    - Increasing ride fare
3. More analysis is needed at individual city level in each city type so that more focused decisions can be made.
